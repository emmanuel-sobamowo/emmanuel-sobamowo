<h1> Hey, I'm Emmanuel and welcome to my profile!</h1>

I am a graduate from the University of Liverpool, with a BA in Business Studies and Politics

Following mhy graduation in 2019, I started work at GetAgent.co.uk as a Customer Service Manager. 

I recently made the decision to puruse a career in the technology industry, following months of online HTML and Javascript courses on Udemy. 

I was fortunate enough to begin my journey with Futureproof and attend the coding bootcamp, training as a full stack developer. 

This is my portfolio with some of the projects I have started, or been a part of.
